## How the Site Works (Big Picture)

```
Your Browser
    ↓
Cloudflare Pages  (hosts the website)
    ↓
GitHub Repo  (source of truth for all files)
    ↑
GitHub Actions  (auto-fetches live scorecards every 20 min)
    ↑
Cloudflare Worker  (triggers GitHub Actions on a reliable cron)
    ↑
SimulatorGolfTour API  (provides live scorecard data)
```

## Components

### 1. Website Hosting — Cloudflare Pages
- **URL:** https://mashup-golf-tour.pages.dev
- **Repo:** https://github.com/khilgend44/mashup-golf-tour
- Every `git push` to `main` auto-deploys the site within ~1 minute.
- No manual deploy step needed.

### 2. Admin Portal — `/admin`
- **URL:** https://mashup-golf-tour.pages.dev/admin
- Protected by **Cloudflare Access** (Google SSO — only approved Google accounts can log in)
- Pages:
  - `/admin/players.html` — manage player roster, view/refresh handicaps
  - `/admin/events.html` — create/manage seasons and events
  - `/admin/teams.html` — draw teams for an event (Steps 1–4):
    - Step 1: Create Random Teams (tiered draw by handicap)
    - Step 2: Generate SGT Loading File (CSV download for SimulatorGolfTour registration)
    - Step 3: Upload SGT Loading File (manual instruction — links to SGT Admin)
    - Step 4: Configure Special Team Orders (Lone Ranger slot assignments)
  - `/admin/poster-preview.html` — generate and send the weekly event announcement:
    - Visual poster preview (exported as PNG via html2canvas)
    - Discord announcement text (format rules, course settings, prizes)
    - Posts to Discord via `/api/announce-event`

### 3. Data Storage — Cloudflare KV
- **Namespace ID:** `a6cbb9bc3e784be88136dbffe9f9796f`
- Stores admin-created data that shouldn't be hardcoded in the repo:
  - `admin:events` — events created via admin portal (Season 10+)
  - `admin:formats` — custom game formats created via admin portal (merged with `data/formats.json` at runtime)
  - `players:roster` — player list (names array)
  - `players:handicaps` — handicap data from SGT API (array of `{ username, rawCap, ... }`)
  - `players:last_refresh` — ISO timestamp of last handicap pull
  - `{eventId}:{playerName}:{round}` — YouTube stream URLs submitted by players
- Static/historical data lives in `data/` JSON files in the repo instead.
- **Adjusted handicap** (used for team draws and posters): `Math.round(rawCap - minRaw)` where `minRaw` is the lowest rawCap across all players. Always an integer, always ≥ 0.

### 4. Scorecard Automation — GitHub Actions
- **Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/fetch-scorecards.yml`
- Fetches live scorecards from SGT API for all non-completed events in the active season
- Commits scorecard JSON files to `data/scorecards/{tournamentId}.json`
- Merges both static `data/events.json` and KV-stored events so admin-created events are included
- **Triggered by:** Cloudflare Worker (not GitHub's built-in scheduler — see below)

### 5. Cron Trigger — Cloudflare Worker
- **Worker name:** `mashup-scorecard-trigger`
- **Cloudflare dashboard:** Workers & Pages → mashup-scorecard-trigger
- Fires every **20 minutes** and calls the GitHub API to trigger the scorecard workflow
- Why not GitHub's built-in scheduler? GitHub's scheduler is unreliable for frequent intervals on public repos — it skips runs. Cloudflare's cron is precise.

### 6. YouTube Stream Submissions
- Players submit their YouTube stream URLs via a form on the site
- **API endpoint:** `functions/api/submit-stream.js`
- Stored in **Cloudflare KV** with key format: `{eventId}:{playerName}:{round}` → YouTube URL
  - Example: `40045:boiler_kh:1` → `https://youtube.com/watch?v=...`
- Supports two modes:
  - **Standard** (up to 4 players sharing one stream URL)
  - **Ringer** (one player, separate Round 1 and Round 2 URLs)
- Also posts a notification to a Discord webhook when a stream is submitted
- Discord webhook URL stored as `DISCORD_STREAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` env var

### 7. Event Announcements (Discord Poster)
- Admin generates a weekly event announcement via `/admin/poster-preview.html`
- **API endpoint:** `functions/api/announce-event.js`
  - Accepts a base64-encoded PNG (the poster) + Discord message text
  - Posts multipart form data to Discord webhook (image + text in one message)
- Discord webhook URL stored as `DISCORD_ANNOUNCE_WEBHOOK_URL` env var

### 8. Public Event Teams Page
- Any event leaderboard (`event.html?id=X`) has a **View Teams** button linking to `event-teams.html?id=X`
- `event-teams.html` is a public read-only page showing the team draw and prizes for an event
- **API endpoint:** `functions/api/event-public.js`
  - Public GET — no Cloudflare Access auth required
  - Returns event data, KV formats, handicaps, and roster for a given event ID
  - Only covers admin-created events (KV-stored, Season 10+); historical events return 404

### 9. SGT Handicap API
- Pulls player handicap data from SimulatorGolfTour
- Rate-limited to **once per 24 hours**; timestamp stored in `players:last_refresh` KV key
- Triggered manually from the admin Players page ("Refresh Handicaps" button)
- The admin Teams page reads the same `players:last_refresh` timestamp and blocks SGT Loading File generation if handicaps are older than 24 hours

## Credentials & Keys (Check These Annually)

| What | Where Stored | Expires | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **GitHub Personal Access Token** | Cloudflare Worker → Settings → Variables & Secrets → `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ~June 2027 | Scope: `workflow` only. Regenerate at GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → PAT (Classic) |
| **SGT Player API Key** | Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables → `player_api_key` | Unknown | Contact SGT admin if it stops working |
| **Discord Streams Webhook** | Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables → `DISCORD_STREAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Never | Used by `/api/submit-stream` to notify the streams channel when a player submits a YouTube link. |
| **Discord Announce Webhook** | Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment Variables → `DISCORD_ANNOUNCE_WEBHOOK_URL` | Never | Used by `/api/announce-event` to post event announcement posters to the announcements channel. |
| **Cloudflare API Token** | GitHub → Repo Settings → Secrets → `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Unknown | Used by GitHub Actions to read/write KV |
| **Cloudflare Account ID** | GitHub → Repo Settings → Secrets → `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Never | Value: `4e0f891a1bcff74ade11ade5d182bac9` |
| **SGT API Key (scorecards)** | GitHub → Repo Settings → Secrets → `SGT_API_KEY` | Unknown | Used by GitHub Actions to fetch scorecards |

---

## How to Renew the GitHub Token (Annual Task)

1. Go to GitHub → profile photo → **Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**
2. Find `mashup-scorecard-trigger` → click **Regenerate**
3. Copy the new token
4. Go to **Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → mashup-scorecard-trigger → Settings → Variables and Secrets**
5. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to `GITHUB_TOKEN` → paste the new token → Save

---

## Starting a New Season

1. Add the new season to `data/seasons.json` in the repo (set old season to `"status": "completed"`, new to `"status": "active"`)
2. Add the season's players array
3. Commit and push — site deploys automatically
4. Create events week-by-week via the **Admin → Events** page
5. Scorecards will start auto-fetching within 20 minutes of event creation

---

## Static Data Files (in Repo)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/seasons.json` | Season definitions and player rosters |
| `data/events.json` | Historical/static events (Seasons 1–9) |
| `data/formats.json` | Built-in game formats (merged with KV `admin:formats` at runtime) |
| `data/scorecards/{id}.json` | Cached scorecard data per tournament |

Admin-created events/formats for Season 10+ live in **Cloudflare KV**, not these files.

## Adding a New Game Format

New formats must be defined in Claude Code — **do not use the admin UI's "New Format" panel** for genuinely new scoring logic. The admin panel only creates named variations of an existing `type`. New scoring logic requires:
1. New function in `js/scoring.js`
2. New `case` in the `applyFormat()` switch statement
3. New entry in `data/formats.json` (with `tiebreakers[]` array)
4. New `<option>` in the admin events.html `nf-type` dropdown

## SGT Loading File (Team Registration CSV)

Before each event, the admin generates a CSV for SimulatorGolfTour via `/admin/teams.html` Step 2:
- **Format:** 10 columns — `Player1, HCP1, Player2, HCP2, Player3, HCP3, Player4, HCP4, teamID, opponentID`
- **Team events:** one row per team, sequential teamID starting at 10001
- **Solo events** (teamSize < 2): one row per player, only first 2 columns filled, no teamID
- **Handicap used:** adjusted handicap (`Math.round(rawCap - minRaw)`) — must be refreshed within 24 hours before generating
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 BOM (`﻿`) required for SGT compatibility
